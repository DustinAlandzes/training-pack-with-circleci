# training-pack-with-circleci

This repository contains Uncle Punch's Training Mode 3.0 Alpha 6 from the Patreon: https://github.com/UnclePunch/Training-Mode

It has a CircleCI config that applys the xdelta patch to a vanilla v1.02 melee iso

I have it stored on my seafile server and am downloading it with wget

You can get a v1.02 melee iso from
